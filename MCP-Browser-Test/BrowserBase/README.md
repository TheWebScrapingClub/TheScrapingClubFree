# Browserbase MCP Server

![cover](assets/cover-mcp.png)

[The Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you‚Äôre building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

This server provides cloud browser automation capabilities using [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/), [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), and [Stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand). This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages, take screenshots, and execute JavaScript in a cloud browser environment.

To learn to get started with Browserbase, check out [Browserbase MCP](./browserbase/README.md) or [Stagehand MCP](./stagehand/README.md).

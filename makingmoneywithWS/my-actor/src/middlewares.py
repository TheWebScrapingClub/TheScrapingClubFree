Scrapy middlewares module

This module defines Scrapy middlewares. Middlewares are processing components that handle requests and
responses, typically used for adding custom headers, retrying requests, and handling exceptions.

There are 2 types of middlewares: spider middlewares and downloader middlewares. For detailed information
on creating and utilizing them, refer to the official documentation:
https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html
https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spider-middleware.html
